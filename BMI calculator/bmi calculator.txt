Define the calculate_bmi() function that takes weight and height as input and calculates the BMI using the formula bmi = weight / (height^2)
Define the bmi_status() function that takes the BMI as input and checks it against certain ranges to determine the user's status (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese) and returns the appropriate status.
Take input of weight and height from the user using the input() function.
Call the calculate_bmi() function with the entered weight and height as arguments and store the result in a variable
Call the bmi_status() function with the BMI as an argument and store the result in a variable
Print the BMI and the status
Use an if-elif block to check the status and print the appropriate warning message.
The program terminates.
